# Code for Frank Luna's book "Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 11" 

WIP

This is the code of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-3D-Game-Programming-DirectX/dp/1936420228) as I port it to Windows 11 and Visual Studio 2022. I am also adding the code for the book exercises as I complete them, in their own branches.

It should just work by opening the solution files and building them from Visual Studio.

I started from [Frank Luna's own port of the Blend Demo](http://www.d3dcoder.net/d3d11.htm).
