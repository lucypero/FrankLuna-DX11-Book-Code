How to port more chapters so that it compiles in windows >= 10:

- Add...

using namespace DirectX;

...when needed. like for math functions.

- DDS loading functions. just look at how the new ones are. they are a bit different.

- Add the missing cpp files in the Common folder to the solution. (dxerr.cpp, DDSTextureLoader.cpp)

- in VS, add ..\..\Common as include folder and library folder.

- in VS, change the library names in the linker input tab as they are on the already ported chapters.
